# Data_Science_Capstone
Capstone project for data science certificate
The projet is to get data on various Chicago neighborhoods, and use multiple classification algorithms to try and create a model that predicts number of
Italian restaurants in a particular neighborhood. This is eventually used to generate a map.
Unfortunately, this project was created some time ago, and some of the library methods it uses to get info from public databases no longer work.
